# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
It Is a Power BI Dashboard
I've divided it into 5 steps.
1. Project Roadmap - In this part I analyzed what is the problem statement.

2.Data Extraction-In this part I made a SQL database and connected that database with Power BI. 

3.data processing and DAX queries 

4.Dashboard and insights - In this part I built 2 dashboards :-

* Credit Card Transaction report 
* Credit Card Customer Report
 ( dashboard is based on weekly basis)
 
5. export and share
